## Abstract
Vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) have long presented challenges to engineers. It is usually modelled with the spectral approach developed by Vickery and coworkers, or with the wake-oscillator approach initially promoted by the works of Hartlen and Currie. In this work a randomized version of the latter is considered, aiming at studying in an alternative manner the influence of turbulence of the oncoming wind on the structure.
Despite extensive experimental studies on turbulence’s impact on VIV, no clear consensus has emerged. Some studies suggest that turbulence can completely suppress VIV by reducing synchronization, while others report minimal effects on response amplitude. These conflicting results highlight the complexity of the problem. Additionally, in contrast with the linear stochastic dynamics problem, the time varying length of the lamina leads the system to be non-linear, and the responses to be non-Gaussian. The stochastic analysis of such systems is particularly difficult because of these “non’s”.
Based on Itô’s formula, Grigoriu proposed the moment equation method to calculate the statistical response of linear systems under random excitations. With this method, the statistical moments of any order of the response can be directly obtained by solving a system of linear differential equations with high efficiency. Although this method has been applied in several wind engineering problems, it has been rarely reported for non-linear non-Gaussian vibration analysis. Particularly, the coupling of nonlinear wake-oscillators, i.e., Van der Pol oscillator, renders the system unclosed so additional tactic should be introduced to make the equation solvable. This paper aims to present a cumulant equation method to investigate the influence of turbulence on vortex induced vibrations. This study is regarded as subsequent research by the authors in order to generalize the previous linear/Gaussian case to a non-linear/non-Gaussian case.
