## Abstract
Extreme winds such as hurricanes and thunderstorms often present non-stationary characteristics, having time-varying mean wind speeds and non-stationary wind fluctuations. When concerning wind-induced vibrations under non-stationary wind, the excitation will be a non-stationary process, and the wind-structure coupled system can be represented by a linear time-varying system. The study aims to present a state augmentation method to investigate the non-stationary buffeting of a long-span bridge subjected to non-stationary wind. The unsteady self-excited forces and the non-stationary turbulence-induced forces, i.e., buffeting forces, are included both in this study to predict the flutter and buffeting response. Based on Itô’s Formula, the statistical moments of the response are derived through solving a first-order ordinary differential equation system. This study is regarded as subsequent research by the author in order to generalize the previous one in a single degree of freedom case to a multiple degree of freedom case and take the unsteady aerodynamic effects into consideration.
